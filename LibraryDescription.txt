Assignment 1: Library

Goals: Write a C++ class with separate .h and .cpp file, use partially filled arrays.

Create a new class called Library that uses a private string array to store the list of books
and supports the following functions:

// Add a new book
// returns true for success, false if the book is already in the library
bool AddBook(const std::string &name);

// Remove a book
// Returns true for success, false if the book is not in the library
bool RemoveBook(const std::string &name);

// List all the books in the Library
void ListAllBooks() const;

// Returns true if the book is in the library, false otherwise
bool IsInLibrary(const std::string &name) const;

// Friend function used to print the library name and the list of books
friend std::ostream &operator<<(std::ostream &out, const Library &lib);
